Reckoning,  
a shadow that looms  
over all  
I attempt.  
Be it work or art or love,  
it all will crumble.  
  
Undeserved  
every boon weighing  
as a threat  
as a debt  
to be collected by force  
when least expected.  
  
Ungrateful   
perhaps, but fearful  
every day  
that goes well  
another cruel delay  
in this ruthless joke.  
  
Now learning  
to see beyond my  
own shadows  
and embrace  
the light I give, am given  
although imperfect.
