<p class="p3">There are at least six of us tonight</p>
<p class="p3">looking out the window at a foreign sky</p>
<p class="p3">who last night had dreams of another land</p>
<p class="p3">the one that saw our birth and holds our love</p>
<p class="p3">and our hate, and the people in our heart</p>
<p class="p3">and all that we gave seeking this promise.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I remember our youth with its promise</p>
<p class="p3">how we’d talk deep, broad, into the night</p>
<p class="p3">of the deepest desires of our heart,</p>
<p class="p3">the crumbling of our castles in the sky</p>
<p class="p3">or how all would be well when we found love</p>
<p class="p3">and a job, a future, in the promised lands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">How we derided and scorned our troubled land</p>
<p class="p3">trapped between seas and dry of promise</p>
<p class="p3">—what rage and scorn in that ripe age of love—</p>
<p class="p3">for all that we could dream, it could benight;</p>
<p class="p3">we felt drowned under the weight of its sky</p>
<p class="p3">and the discontent would gnaw at our hearts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">It was fertile ground, then, our tender heart</p>
<p class="p3">for the seed to grow, to pine for a land</p>
<p class="p3">full of freedom and with an open sky</p>
<p class="p3">to develop our talent and promise,</p>
<p class="p3">to walk and enjoy without fear at night,</p>
<p class="p3">or fear in daylight when we found love.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">And perhaps each of us has found much love</p>
<p class="p3">but not without bruises upon our heart</p>
<p class="p3">not without staying up late at night</p>
<p class="p3">fearing we’d be disallowed from these lands</p>
<p class="p3">when we were so close to that life promised</p>
<p class="p3">—we know well these heavy clouds in our sky.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Maybe today we looked at this other sky</p>
<p class="p3">and we found a new note in our love</p>
<p class="p3">mixed with nostalgia, perhaps, a promise</p>
<p class="p3">to see again those we hold in our hearts</p>
<p class="p3">and cherish those we’ve found in these lands</p>
<p class="p3">before the past swallows them in its night.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Under this foreign sky I pour imperfect my heart</p>
<p class="p3">with words of love for you, who remember that land,</p>
<p class="p3">who hold on to a promise, who’ll dream again tonight.</p>
