<p class="p3">It begins innocent: from survival, nature,</p>
<p class="p3">children in dark hallways soon are frozen by fear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">We follow our impulse of self-discovery</p>
<p class="p3">until peers or doubt render us frozen by fear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The solace of love eludes most the cowardly,</p>
<p class="p3">those who cannot bear defeat are frozen by fear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Our life happens to usâ€”divine dictum and curse</p>
<p class="p3">when we forfeit its reins and are frozen by fear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Questions not asked and words never spoken aloud</p>
<p class="p3">tarnish the world pitch black, we are frozen by fear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Authorities and their draconian reveries,</p>
<p class="p3">thrive on the cowering of those frozen by fear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">After the many pitfalls that befall the brave,</p>
<p class="p3">some of us revel in being frozen by fear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Will you dear reader, will I, choose also this fate?</p>
<p class="p3">Or look up and ahead, not down, frozen by fear?</p>
