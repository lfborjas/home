<p class="p3">(Enthralled on a Thursday—in a third-world abode):</p>
<p class="p3">I remember the marvel—murkiness notwithstanding</p>
<p class="p3">with which I was wooed—by the wonder of art.</p>
<p class="p3">Befuddled and fawning—over the French of Baudelaire</p>
<p class="p3">enmeshed until midnight—by the mythical Tolkien</p>
<p class="p3">spellbound and soaring— with the Song of the Earth;</p>
<p class="p3">with the grandeur and gusto—of the gracious Dalí</p>
<p class="p3">or the deepest indictments—in the deft hands of Kundera.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">(In a plane that’s departing; in pensive insomnia):</p>
<p class="p3">I ruminate ruefully; for in my roaming and travels</p>
<p class="p3">broke and bright-eyed; brimming with youth</p>
<p class="p3">when walking, just wandering; in the walkways of Prague,</p>
<p class="p3">when traipsing in trains; timidly through Germany,</p>
<p class="p3">when nervously nearing; those nebulous borders</p>
<p class="p3">I wouldn’t have wagered; nor wondered ever</p>
<p class="p3">this noxious notion; that nations would sour.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">(In a brownstone in Brooklyn. Brooding on weekends):</p>
<p class="p3">This breaking of brethren. Buried for long now,</p>
<p class="p3">or so I thought, threatens. A thorn in our present.</p>
<p class="p3">And perhaps it happens. Some heinous characters</p>
<p class="p3">tarnish all with terror. And the trust then crumbles.</p>
<p class="p3">Arise despicable parties. Peddling the hatred,</p>
<p class="p3">seeking to tear asunder. Not salvage our peace,</p>
<p class="p3">but to shatter our shelters. And the sharing of Culture.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">(In a queue for questioning: quivering with anxiety):</p>
<p class="p3">In this baleful bleakness: this blackening of hearts.</p>
<p class="p3">In this anxious ardor: this aura of menace.</p>
<p class="p3">We can’t cower: though courage is lacking</p>
<p class="p3">when displaced and disparaged: when impunity reigns.</p>
<p class="p3">Our world heritage is hallowed: we haven’t a reason</p>
<p class="p3">to lose our first love: the lore of the ages.</p>
<p class="p3">And heal this, our hell: make whole what is tatters.</p>
